Feature: Add/Edit Lessons 

  As an administrator
  I want to create a lesson with   the following information:
  - Title
  - Instructor
  - Grade level
  - Day and time
  - Room location
  - Max enrollment
  - Description
  So that I have all pertinent information and can access and edit at another time.
  Background: classes Instruction database

      Given the following lessons exist:
 | title        | instructor| grade_level | starts_at         | location        | max_enrollment | description |
 | Star Wars 101| Han Solo  | 1-3         | 1414339890        | galaxy far away | 7              | |
 | Star Wars 102| luke      | 3-5         | 1414339890339890  | jedi academy    | 7 		 | |
 | Death star   | Darth     | 6-8         | 1414339890        | not death star  | 7 		 | |
 | Dancing      | Usher     | 6-8         | 1414339890        | galaxy away     | 7 		 | |

    When I go to the edit classss for "Star Wars 102"
